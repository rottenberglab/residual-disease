**Abstract**: Breast cancer remains one of the prominent causes of death worldwide. Although chemotherapeutic agents 
often result in substantial reduction of primary or metastatic tumours, remaining drug-tolerant tumour cell 
populations, known as minimal residual disease (MRD), pose a significant risk of recurrence and therapy resistance. 
In this study, we describe the spatiotemporal organisation of therapy response and MRD in BRCA1;p53-deficient mouse 
mammary tumours and human clinical samples using a multimodal approach. By integrating single-cell RNA sequencing, 
spatial transcriptomics, and imaging mass cytometry across multiple treatment timepoints, we characterise dynamic 
interactions between tumour cell subpopulations and their surrounding microenvironment. Our analysis identifies a 
distinct, drug-tolerant epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) cancer cell population, which exhibits a conserved 
expression program in human BRCA1-deficient tumours and significantly correlates with adverse clinical outcomes. We 
further reveal the spatial distribution of residual EMT-like tumour cells within specific anatomical niches, providing 
a framework for understanding the persistence of MRD and potential therapeutic vulnerabilities. These findings yield 
a comprehensive molecular roadmap of MRD, opening new avenues for therapeutic strategies targeting EMT-driven drug 
tolerance and tumour relapse.
